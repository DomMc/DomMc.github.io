        <h2>Industry Placement - Sumo Digital, Sheffield</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="portfolio">
                I completed a year long placement at Sumo Digital in Sheffield. For 6 months I worked on a team-based game developed in Unreal Engine. The game was in the early
                stages of development and has since been cancelled. While on the project, I oversaw building 3 gameplay features as per the design provided to me. I had
                a lot of freedom to experiment with the way these features were deployed, and I regularly presented to the wider multidiscipline team to demonstrate progress and
                make changes based on their feedback.
                <br><br><br>
                The final 6 months of my placement were spent working on a AAA game for a well-known publisher. My work mainly consisted of gameplay programming in C++, however,
                the game was in the final stages of development when I joined the project, so I often took on bugs from all over the codebase when required. I also implemented a
                last minute change to the animation system, which earned me some very good feedback. Once the game is announced I'll update this post to show off the incredible
                result!

        <h2>Zool Redimensioned Port</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="portfolio">
                Working in Sheffield Hallam University's game studio, Steel Minions, I and 9 other students created 2 ports of Sumo Digital Academy's DX11 version of Zool Redimensioned.
                One port was made for Vulkan, and the other was made for the PS4. My team focused on the Vulkan port, and most of my work was on converting the display manager
                and swapchain to Vulkan.
                <br><br><br>
                The project was a finalist at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2022 in the Industry Collaboration category.
                The project also earned second place in the Games Technology category at Games Republic 2022. The PS4 version was later released in May 2023, which gave me my
                first game credit.
