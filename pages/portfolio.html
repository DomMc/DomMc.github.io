        <h2>Samaritan Graphics Research Framework</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                My master's degree required lots of independent research. This inspired me to create Samaritan, an application framework built from scratch in C++. Samaritan can
                render using either DX12 or Vulkan, allowing me to conduct comparative analysis between API's. I hope to turn Samaritan into a tool that new developers can use
                when they begin studying graphics concepts at university.

        <h2>Ray marching</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="portfolio">
                I used my Samaritan research framework to build a ray marching engine using DX12 to render.
                <br><br><br>
                I demonstrated the way ray marching allows the simple calculation of shadows by marching towards each light source. I then demonstrated how we can estimate shadow
                strength by defining it as proportional to the distance to the surface over the distance along the ray.

            <p class="portfolio">
                I then demonstrated Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), which is the concept of constructing complex shapes from simple shapes. When using ray marching, this can be
                achieved using simple Boolen operations such as intersection.
                <br><br><br>
                Intersection is essentially a max function, union is a min function, and difference is the max of x, -y. As shown in the image, these functions provide quite a
                sharp edge where the shapes meet. This can be mitigated with a smoothing function.

                I devloped my own smooth minimum function using existing mathematics research to support my methods. Described here from top - bottom, left - right.
                <br><br><br>
                Using my Union function as a base (green curve), I transformed the associated curve by clamping its gradient between 0 and 1, then transforming by 0.5
                so that the x/y intersection occurs at 0.5 rather than 0. This produces the purple curve.
                <br><br><br>
                Putting that together gives us the red curve in the bottom left. We can smooth out the bump using a curve which is 0 at the start and end of the bump. I refer to
                this as the local maxima (black curve). Combining this curve with the smooth-ish curve gives us the final smooth union curve in red on the bottom right.

                I've compared my smooth union with that of Inigo Quilez, and of the videogame Dreams, which uses a very similar approach to Quilez.
                <br><br><br>
                While certainly not perfect, my smooth union is a success!

                Continuing my ray marching research, I demonstrated domain repetition. This is a bonus of ray marching, which allows the repetition of geometry for no extra cost.
                <br><br><br>
                This works because we transform the ray intersection point before caluclating the Signed Distance Field of the shape which we wish to draw. This calculation has
                to happen regardless of whether we run the transformation function, so the repetition is basically free.

                My maths research inspired me to take this further, and I attempted to render a Mandlebulb. This involves transforming the point with a rotation and scale, after
                having converted to polar coordinates.
                <br><br><br>
                I based my formula for the Mandebulb on several sources online listed below. The result of a power of 2 transformation is clearly related to the original Mandlebrot,
                whereas the 8th power produces the Mandlebulb first proposed by David White.

        <h2>Parallelism</h2>

                I completed two pieces of research demonstrating the effectiveness of different parallel programming techniques. Both were built within my Samaritan framework.

                The first demonstrated Vulkan compute by implementing a particle system with approximately 8 million particles. The GPU was saturated using workgroup invocation
                tuning which queries the GPU workgroup invocation limit and then divides that by the number of particles. This means that in the worst case, only one workgroup
                will be partially utilised.
                <br><br><br>
                The system also utilises a Vulkan extension to mitigate control divergence using subgroup polling. This doesn't necessarily speed up the application, but it does
                improve large frame time spikes that can occur in workgroups with lots of branching. More detail can be found in the full report at the end of this entry, which
                was submitted as part of my master's degree.

                For the second, I created a CPU-based ray tracer with the aim of demonstrating a custom job system. I compared my job system with std::execution::par, which can be
                used within rang-based for loops to provide parallelism with little effort on the part of the programmer.
                <br><br><br>
                It is still the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that the task is suitable for threading,
                but the STL provides a good middle ground in cases where the cost/benefit ratio of development means a job system isn't suitable.

        <h2>Industry Placement - Sumo Digital, Sheffield</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="portfolio">
                I completed a year long placement at Sumo Digital in Sheffield. For 6 months I worked on a team-based game developed in Unreal Engine. The game was in the early
                stages of development and has since been cancelled. While on the project, I oversaw building 3 gameplay features as per the design provided to me. I had
                a lot of freedom to experiment with the way these features were deployed, and I regularly presented to the wider multidiscipline team to demonstrate progress and
                make changes based on their feedback.
                <br><br><br>
                The final 6 months of my placement were spent working on a AAA game for a well-known publisher. My work mainly consisted of gameplay programming in C++, however,
                the game was in the final stages of development when I joined the project, so I often took on bugs from all over the codebase when required. I also implemented a
                last minute change to the animation system, which earned me some very good feedback. Once the game is announced I'll update this post to show off the incredible
                result!

        <h2>Zool Redimensioned Port</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="portfolio">
                Working in Sheffield Hallam University's game studio, Steel Minions, I and 9 other students created 2 ports of Sumo Digital Academy's DX11 version of Zool
                Redimensioned. One port was made for Vulkan, and the other was made for the PS4. My team focused on the Vulkan port, and most of my work was on converting
                the display manager and swapchain to Vulkan.
                <br><br><br>
                The project was a finalist at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2022 in the Industry Collaboration category.
                The project also earned second place in the Games Technology category at Games Republic 2022. The PS4 version was later released in May 2023, which gave me my
                first game credit.
