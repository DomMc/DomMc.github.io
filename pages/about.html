                I've worked at Sumo Digital since July 2024 as a Junior Programmer. I'm a generalist who can turn their hands to most things, and I have experience in 
				gameplay, graphics, tools, UI, and 3C's programming. I am always keen to learn and to be the best programmer I can be, which I believe is demonstrated by 
				the fact that I am a multiple finalist at TIGA, and I earned the TIGA Postgraduate of the Year Accolade in 2024.
				<br /><br />
				I hold a first-class MCOMP in Computer Science for Games, which involved 4 years of study and 1 year in industry at Sumo Digital. The focus of my degree was 
				low level C++ programming using various API's. I have the most experience with Vulkan and DX12, but I've also worked with DX11, PS4 and PS5.
                <br /><br />
                I was part of a team of students at Steel Minions (Sheffield Hallam University's game studio) who ported Zool Redimensioned to PS4 and to Vulkan. The project 
				was a finalist at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2022, and the PS4 port was released in May 2023. Zool Redimensioned is special for me as it was my first credit.
                <br /><br />
                My dissertation focussed on improving fine motor skills in FPS players, and I developed my own take on motor-chunking theory. It was recognised with the Outstanding 
				Research Award at Game Over 2024, hosted by Sheffield Hallam University, and it was a finalist for the TIGA Excellence in Games Research Award 2024.
