        <h1>About me</h1>

            <p class="about">
                My degree involved 4 years of study and 1 year in industry at Sumo Digital. The focus of my degree was low level C++ programming using various API's. 
                I have the most experience with Vulkan and DX12, but I've also worked with DX11, PS4 and PS5.
                <br /><br />
                My most notable university project involved a collaboration between Steel Minions (Sheffield Hallam University's game studio)
                and Sumo Digital Academy. Steel Minions produced 2 ports of Zool Redimensioned, 1 for PS4, and 1 for Vulkan which was the focus 
                for my team. The project was a finalist at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2022, and the PS4 port was released in May 2023. 
                Zool Redimensioned is special for me as it was my first credit.
                <br /><br />
                My dissertation was recognised with the Outstanding Research Award at Game Over 2024, hosted by Sheffield Hallam University. I am also nominated 
                for the Excellence in Games Research Award, and the Outstanding Postgraduate of the Year award, at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2024.
