                My career in games began after 11 years in the rail industry. Adapting for a new career was challenging, particularly retraining after so long
                out of education, but I've enjoyed every day of it. I earned a 1st class master's degree at Sheffield Hallam University in 2024, and began 
                my programming career at Sumo Digital in Sheffield.
                <br /><br />
                Making careers in STEM more accessible to young people is something I am passionate about. I've taken every opportunity to help young people 
                pursue these careers. I've spoken at events ranging from open days to the Games Education Summit, and I’ve delivered workshops in secondary schools. 
                If you have an event that needs someone keen to encourage people into tech careers, then feel free to reach out!
