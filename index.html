                My career in games began after 11 years in the rail industry. Adapting for a new career was challenging, particularly retraining after so long
                out of education, but I've enjoyed every day of it.
                <br /><br />
                The focus of my degree was low level C++ programming using various API's. I have the most experience with Vulkan and DX12, but have worked with
                DX11, PS4 and PS5. My most notable university project involved a collaboration between Steel Minions (Sheffield Hallam University's game studio)
                and Sumo Digital Academy. Steel Minions produced 2 ports of Zool Redimensioned, 1 for PS4 and 1 for Vulkan. My team focused on the Vulkan port,
                and the project was a finalist at the TIGA UK Games Education Awards 2022. The PS4 port was released in May 2023 and is special for me as it was
                my first credit.

                I've always been aware of how fortunate I am to have had the opportunities that I have, and making STEM careers accessible for everyone is
                something that I'm passionate about. I've spoken at events, some of which had 100+ attendees, ranging from open days to the Games Education
                Summit, and I’ve delivered workshops in secondary schools. If you have an event that needs someone keen to encourage people into tech careers,
                then feel free to reach out!
